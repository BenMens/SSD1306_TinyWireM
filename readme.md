# SSD1306_TinyWireM

This Arduino library uses TinyWireM to control a SSD1306 display. It is
developed on a Attiny85 but should work on all devices that are supported by
TinyWireM.


# Notes

 - This library is tested with:
   - (adafruit/TinyWireM)[https://github.com/adafruit/TinyWireM]
   - a Attiny85
